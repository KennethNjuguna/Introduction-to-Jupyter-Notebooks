# Introduction-to-Jupyter-Notebooks

<p> This is my first Jupyter notebook file </p>
<p> It contains introduction to seaborn plots within Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p> Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents. Jupyter Notebook is built using several open-source libraries, including IPython, ZeroMQ, Tornado, jQuery, Bootstrap, and MathJax. </p>

<p> Jupyter Notebook is similar to the notebook interface of other programs such as Maple, Mathematica, and SageMath, a computational interface style that originated with Mathematica in the 1980s. Jupyter interest overtook the popularity of the Mathematica notebook interface in early 2018. </p>

<p> Open-source project that lets you easily combine Markdown text and executable Python source code on one canvas called a notebook. Visual Studio Code supports working with Jupyter Notebooks natively, and through Python code files. Through visual code you can do the following: </p>

<p><ul>
<li>Create, open, and save Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
<li>Work with Jupyter code cells.</li>
<li>View, inspect, and filter variables using the Variable Explorer and Data Viewer.</li>
<li>Connect to a remote Jupyter server.</li>
<li>Debug a Jupyter Notebook.</li>
</ul></p>
